BSD &amp; Generally Geek Related Stuff
Always interested in security. Main reason for choosing OpenBSD
opensource operating system long way back. Ran it for nine years
total. Went back to it in disgust at Windows operating system
after it wiped out on my laptop. Wiped the drive, installed
the latest OpenBSD release, and never looked back.
